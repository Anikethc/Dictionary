# Dictionary

Hello Everyone! Welcome to my GitHub repo 'Dictionary'. I created a dictionary program in Python.

## How to Use It?

Please download this project into one directory itself `Dictionary` in the root of your C drive.

This project is a dictionary app where in if you type a word, it gives you the definition. Even if you enter a wrong word, this program can sometimes correct you in what you actually wanted to say.

The `data.json` is a file with all the words and definitions. The Python program interacts with the JSON file to get you the meaning of the word.

## Can You Use It?

Yes, you can download this repo and use it for your own purposes.

You have the right to download, modify, and share it to others. But, don't sell it to anyone.
